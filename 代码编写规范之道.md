**代码编写规范之道**--努力践行python之禅

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
	美丽优于丑陋
Explicit is better than implicit.
	外直优于内敛
Simple is better than complex.
	简单优于复杂
Complex is better than complicated.
    复杂优于苦涩
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is be tter than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
